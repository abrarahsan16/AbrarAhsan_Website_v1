                From internships to research experience, I have been involved in
                a variety of roles to expand my skillsets as well as learn about
                the industry itself.

              </p>
              <p>
                My research focus was in computer vision, particularly with a
                neuromorphic vision called SCAMP-5 which is a focal-plane
                sensor-processor (FPSP) array. My supervisor is Dr Sajad Saeedi,
                whos guidance has helped me improve my knowledge and skills in
                robotic navigation as well as in computer vision.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Researched topics surrounding the use of deep learning methods
                  for robotic navigation applications. Topics focused on
                  camera-based navigation using supervised learning techniques
                  with features learned from images alone.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Developed shallow convolutional neural network (CNN) and
                  implemented on a neuromorphic vision sensor (SCAMP-5) for
                  navigation in corridor and racetrack settings using a Jetbot
                  chassis.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Image data was collected first from custom Gazebo worlds and
                  verified by running a turtlebot using other Gazebo worlds
                  before implementing into the real world.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The performance of the SCAMP-5 was compared against the Jetson
                  Nano's CPU, CPU+GPU, as well as the Intel ComputeStick2 VPU.

                De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Ltd is an an aircraft
                manufacturer based out of Downsview, Toronto, Canada. The
                original De Havilland of Canada was established in 1928 to help
                with the war effort. Sold to Boeing in 1980s and then
                Bombardier, the company was revived by Longview Aviation Capital
                by purchasing the Q400 program along with the rights to de
                Havilland name and trademark.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Developed the Corrosion Reporting and Database software (CPCP)

                  Automated the creation of the Maintenance Review Board (MRB)
                  Integrated Schedule to reduce the creation time for each

                  department to coordinate with regulatory bodies such as the
                  FAA and EASA to easily set up maintenance task review meetings
